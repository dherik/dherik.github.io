This is now my official page (and blog)! 

I've been writing for a while some articles on my previous [Blog](https://qualidadegarantida.blogspot.com) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@dherik) (both on Brazillian Portuguese). But now I feel prepared to take a bigger step and write for a bigger audience using the most spoken language among the developers around the world. 

The other news is my new domain. I already bought the [dherik.com](http://dherik.com) domain. I will use it to point to this page!

I will still be publishing some Portuguese articles on Medium. As the CWI Software publish most of my articles, it's a good deal to help me to promote my blog and I really enjoy to write texts using my native language :). My old blog will be still online until I understand that it's time to deactivated, but I don't have any intention to do that soon.
