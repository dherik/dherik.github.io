My name is Dherik Barison. I'm a developer with over 10 years of experience, having worked as a Tech Lead and Engineering Manager. Now, I'm eager to share some of my knowledge with the world :).

# History

I grew up in Camb√©, Brazil. I attended the State University of Londrina (UEL) from 2006 to 2010, where I earned a BS in Computer Science. After graduating, I moved to Campinas and completed a master's degree at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp). Following my academic journey, I worked at various companies, including Dextra (4 years), MATERA Systems (1 year), Confidence Exchange (2 years), CWI Software (2 years), and Axur (2 years). Currently, I am employed at SAP.
