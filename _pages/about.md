# History

I grew up in Camb√©, Brazil. I went to State University of Londrina (UEL) from 2006-2010 where I got a BS in Computer Science. After graduating I moved to Campinas and got a master graduation on State University of Campinas (Unicamp). After that I left my academic career and worked on different companies: Dextra (4 years), MATERA Systems (1 year), Confidence Exchange (2 years), CWI Software (2 years). Now I'm working on Axur.
